## Reflections  
  
  
### Computer Mouse 
**Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure that it is of the highest quality.**  
...
  
  
### Catastrophe failure
**Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?**
....

#Investigation Tools
## JUnit 5
**Investigate JUnit 5 (Jupiter). Explain the following, and how they are useful:**
| Annotations       | Usage                                                             |
| -------------     |-------------------------------------------                        |
| **@Tag**          | Used to tag classes for filtering                                 |
| **@Disabled**     | Used to disable a test class or method                            |
| **@RepeatedTest**  | Indicates that a method is a test template for a repeated class   |
| **@BeforeEach, @AfterEach** | **BeforeEach** should be executed before each **@Test**. **AfterEach** should be executed after each **@Test** |
| **@DisplayName** | Used for defining a custom display name for the test class or method |
| **@Nested** | Indicates that the class is a non-static nested test class |
| **assumeFalse, assumeTrue** | **assumeTrue()** If called with an expression evaluating to false, the test will halt and be ignored. **assumeFalse()** is the inverse of **assumeTrue()** |

## Mocking Frameworks
**Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least
two frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which
we saw in class.)**  
**What are their similarities?**  
**What are their differences?**  
**Which one would you prefer, if any, and why?**
